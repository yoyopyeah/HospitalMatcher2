# HospitalMatcher2
Our project for McHacks 2021.

## Inspiration
In many developing countries, for example, Cairo, you often need to drive to a hospital yourself in case of an emergency. 
In such urgent situations, time is the most valuable and crucial factor, and if one end up driving the patient to mulitple hospitals until finding an available spot, the time lost can be devastating. 

## What it does
The HospitalMatcher is an android application that matches the user with the nearest hospital with available spots with respect to their current location. For demo purposes, we have manually extracted the information of some hospitals in Montreal. To ensure accuracy, we plan to give the hospitals the permission to update the availability.

## Implementation
Used Android Studio to build the application, adapted Github to increase team-productivity, incorporated Google Map API to find the closest hospitals to the user in terms of travel time, which includes the use of JSON.

## What's next for HospitalMatcher
Fine-tune the Google Map API, design better UX/UI, upload hospital profiles and invite hospitals to update their availability.
